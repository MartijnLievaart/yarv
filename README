YARV -- Yet Another RRD Viewer

  -= OVERVIEW =-

Yarv is a web based RRD viewer. I wrote it because I was not satisfied
with other viewers. It aims to be very featureful while still easy to
deploy.

Although only tested with apache/mod_perl, it should work as a normal
(perl) CGI under all webservers that support perl cgis.

  -= FEATURES =-

Currently implemented:

* Allow choosing from multiple RRDs in a directory
* Automatically find DSses to show
* Zoom in and out with the mouse
* Allow arbitrary time ranges from input controls
* Administrator can choose size of graph
* Multiple directories can be made available by administrator
* Every directory can have its own settings

Planned:

* Allow user to control which DSses to show
* Allow splitting in multiple graphs (f.i. split on .*-in and .*-out)
* Allow combining DSses from multiple RRDs into one graph
* Better integration with JQuery
* When symlinked, look for config file with that name
* Allow embedding in another site (mostly done)
* Allow multiple instances on one webpage (mostly done)
* Provide a basic interface if no JavaScript (mostly done)

  -= BUGS =-

Bugs? Never! But if you find one, please file a ticket at https://github.com/MartijnLievaart/yarv

Known issues:
* Does not work (well) without JavaScript
* What browsers are exactly supported?
